| | They use an  |
| inofficial     |
| EPSG-Code      |
| 325833 which   |
| is EPSG:25833  |
| with an        |
| additional     |
| |  false       |
| easting of     |
| 3000 km (which |
| is the         |
| official CRS   |
| for            |
| Brandenburg,   |
| ETRS89         |
| |  with 7      |
| digit          |
| rightings).    |

| |  These       |
| servers have   |
| just been      |
| moved to a new |
| system two     |
| weeks ago.     |
|                |
| | I also have  |
| WMSs for       |
| Saxony,        |
| including DOPs |
| from the great |
| flood in 2003, |
| but            |
| |  right now I |
| get 502 Proxy  |
| Errors for the |
| whole website  |
| of the         |
| department of  |
| |  geography   |
| of Saxony.     |
| |  The         |
| saxonian       |
| servers have   |
| been used by   |
| me in uDig. I  |
| might add them |
| later on       |
| |  if anyone   |
| wishes them to |
| be included.   |
