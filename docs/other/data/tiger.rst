| ============== |
| =========      |
|                |
| David Bitner   |
| is putting to  |
| gether a       |
| series of      |
| notes on       |
| setting up     |
| TIGER/VMAP     |
| data. The goal |
| is to pull     |
| together       |
| datasets that  |
| will provided  |
| a US basemap   |
| down to street |
| level.         |
|                |
| The goal that  |
| I have for     |
| this wiki is   |
| to provide     |
| recipes to     |
| pull public    |
| data and to    |
| process it for |
| efficient use  |
| at several     |
| different      |
| resolutions.   |
| In the case of |
| roads, this    |
| would mean     |
| being able     |
| have a roads   |
| map that one   |
| could easily   |
| zoom from a    |
| national scale |
| map and get    |
| more and more  |
| information    |
| (as well as    |
| more detailed  |
| information)   |
| as you zoom in |
| to street      |
| level by       |
| filtering out  |
| data at        |
| different      |
| levels as well |
| as             |
| generalizing   |
| datasets. I    |
| envision this  |
| being a place  |
| that can be    |
| used for any   |
| datasets that  |
| are publicly   |
| available, but |
| not            |
| necessarily in |
| a form that is |
| immediately    |
| useful. The    |
| initial two    |
| that I have    |
| identified are |
| TIGER and      |
| VMAP.          |
|                |
| Thanks for     |
| participating! |
|                |
| David          |
